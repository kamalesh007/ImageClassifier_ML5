# ImageClassifier_ML5
The above is the code for image classification in p5.js using ml5.js and mobilenet. This uses a pretrained model for prediction.
Learnt from youtube channel "The coding Train" by Daniel Shiffman.
:)
It classifies good for most of the images.
Run the index.html file in the browser and add your own images into the images folder and change the file name in sketch.js .
The output takes 30s-60s to be displayed .. so please wait.
Thanks :)
